"""
Entry point for running the Pyramid backend in development or production.

This script loads the WSGI application defined in ``backend/app`` via
PasteDeploy and serves it using Waitress.  It honours the ``PORT``
environment variable to allow overriding the default port of 6543.
The application will automatically read its database URL from the
``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable when present; otherwise it falls
back to the ``sqlalchemy.url`` setting in ``development.ini``.  This
design allows seamless deployment to services like Railway (where a
PostgreSQL URL is injected via ``DATABASE_URL``) while still
supporting local development with SQLite.

Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd backend
    python run.py

You can override the port by setting the PORT environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    PORT=8000 python run.py
