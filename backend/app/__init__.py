# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORS subscriber
#
# To support cross‑origin requests from the frontend (which typically runs on
# a different port during development), we attach a NewResponse subscriber.
# This subscriber sets the appropriate CORS headers on every response. It
# allows any GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS request and accepts the common
# headers used by our frontend (Content‑Type and Authorization). The allowed
# origins are read from the ``cors.origins`` setting in the ``.ini`` file. If
# no origins are specified, ``*`` is used, allowing all origins. When multiple
# origins are specified, the subscriber echoes back the request's Origin if it
# appears in the allowed list; otherwise, it falls back to the first value.

    """Main application entry point

    This function is responsible for configuring the Pyramid application and
    setting up the database connection.  By default, Pyramid will read the
    database URL from the ``sqlalchemy.url`` key in the settings passed in
    (typically via the ``.ini`` file).  However, running the application in
    different environments often requires different database backends.  When
    deploying to Railway or another hosted service, an external PostgreSQL URL
    is used.  When running locally without network access, that URL will
    inevitably fail.  To support both scenarios seamlessly, this function
    checks for a ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable first.  If present,
    that value is used; otherwise it falls back to the ``sqlalchemy.url``
    configured in the settings.  Should connecting to the chosen database
    raise an exception (for example, because the remote host is unreachable),
    the code gracefully falls back to a local SQLite database stored in
    ``library.db``.  The result is an engine that always binds successfully.

    Args:
        global_config: Deployment configuration supplied by PasteDeploy.
        **settings: Arbitrary configuration keys read from the INI file.

    Returns:
