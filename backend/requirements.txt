#
# Requirements for the Pyramid backend.  These packages are required
# to run the backend defined in ``backend/app``.  They match the
# dependencies declared in setup.py and are consistent with the UAS
# specification (Python Pyramid, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Alembic).

# Pyramid web framework
pyramid
pyramid-tm

# Database ORM and driver
SQLAlchemy
psycopg2-binary

# Database migrations
alembic

# Pyramid integrates SQLAlchemy with transaction management via
# ``zope.sqlalchemy``.  This dependency is explicitly added here because
# it is not pulled in automatically by Pyramid.  Without it, running
# Alembic migrations or importing models will result in a
# ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'zope.sqlalchemy'``.  See
# https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/transactions.html
zope.sqlalchemy

# Password hashing
bcrypt

# JWT authentication
PyJWT

# Environment variable parsing
python-dotenv

# Production WSGI server
waitress

# Testing (optional)
pytest
